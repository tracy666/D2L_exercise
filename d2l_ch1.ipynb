    "In general, any part of the code that involves making design choices or requires the use of heuristics could potentially be improved through machine learning. For example, in a computer vision application, the choice of filters and parameters to use for image processing could be learned through deep learning techniques. Similarly, in a natural language processing application, the choice of features and models for text classification could be learned.\n",

    "To train a machine learning model to improve the design choices in the code, relevant data would need to be collected and labeled with the desired behavior. For example, in the computer vision application, labeled images could be used to train a model to learn the optimal filters and parameters for image processing. In the natural language processing application, labeled text data could be used to train a model to learn the optimal features and models for text classification."

    "Many problems in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition have many examples for how to solve them, yet no specific way to automate them. These problems may be prime candidates for using deep learning, as deep learning can automatically learn to solve complex problems from large amounts of labeled data.\n",

In speech recognition, tasks such as speech-to-text conversion and speaker identification have many examples for how to solve them, but no specific algorithm can handle all variations of these tasks.\n",

For example, deep learning algorithms are well-suited for processing large amounts of complex data, such as images and text, but require significant computational resources to train.
